    "Avalanche": "I stepped into an avalanche\nIt covered up my soul\nWhen I am not this hunchback that you see\nI sleep beneath the golden hill\nYou, who wish to conquer pain\nYou, must learn, learn to serve me well\n\nYou strike my side by accident\nAs you go down to your goal\nThis cripple here that you clothe and feed\nIs neither starved nor cold\nHe does not ask for your company\nNot at the centre, the centre of the world\n\nAnd I am on a pedestal\nYou did not raise me there\nYour laws do not compel me now\nTo kneel grotesque and bare\nI, myself, am the pedestal\nFor this ugly hump at which you stare\n\nYou who wish to conquer pain\nYou must learn what makes me kind\nThe crumbs of love that you offer me\nAre the crumbs I’ve left behind\nYour pain is no credential here\nIt’s just a shadow of my wound\n\nI have begun to ask for you\nI, who have no greed\nI have begun to long for you\nI, who have no need\nYou say you’ve gone away from me\nBut I can feel you when you breathe\n\nDo not dress in those rags for me\nI know you are not poor\nAnd do not love me quite so fiercely now\nWhen you know that you are not sure\nIt is your turn, my beloved one\nIt is your flesh that I wear",
    "Cabin Fever": "The Captain’s fore-arm like bunched-up rope\nWith A-N-I-T-A wriggling free on a skull’n’dagger\nAnd a portrait of Christ, nailed to an anchor\nEtched into his upper…\n\nO o o’ Cabin Fever!\nO o o’ Cabin Fever!\n\nSlams his fucking tin-dish down\nOur Captain, takes time to crush\nSome Bloo-Bottles glowin in his gruel\nWith a lump in his throat, and lumpy mush\nThumbing a scrapbook stuck up with clag\nAnd a morbid lump of Love in his flags\nDone is the Missing, now all that remain\nIs to sail forever, upon the stain\n\nCabin Fever! O o o’ Cabin Fever!\n\nThe captains free-hand is a cleaver\nWhich he fashions his beard, and he rations his jerky!\nAnd carves his peg outta the finest mahogany!\nOr was it Ebony?\nTallies up his loneliness, notch by notch\n‘Cause the sea offers nothing to hold or touch\nNotch by notch, winter by winter\nNotch by notch, winter by winter\nNow his leg is whittled, right down to a splinter\n\nO o Cabin Fever! O o o Cabin Fever!\nO the rollin sea keeps rollin on!\nO the rollin sea keeps rollin on!\nShe’s everywhere! now that she’s gone!\nShe’s everywhere! now that she’s gone! Gone! Gone!\nO Cabin Fever!\n\nWelcome to his table, Beloved-Unconscious\nRaisin her host of hair from her crooks\nAnd struggling to summon one of her looks!\nHis arm now like coiled s-s-s-snakes\nWhips all the bottles that he’s drunken\nLike crystal – skittles about the cabin\nOf a ship they’d been sailing\nFive years sunken",
    "Well Of Misery": "Along crags and sunless cracks I go\nUp rib of rock, down spine of stone\nI dare not slumber where the night winds whistle\nLest her creeping-soul clutch this heart of thistle\n\nO the same God that abandoned her\nHas, in turn abandoned me\nAnd softenin’ the turf with my tears\nI dug a Well of Misery\n\nAnd, in that Well of Misery\nHangs a bucket full Sorrow\nWhich swings slow an’ actin’ like a bell\nIts toll is dead and hollow\n\nDown that well lies the long-lost dress\nOf my lil floatin girl\nThat muffles a tear that you let fall\nAll down that Well of Misery\n\nPut ya shoulder to the handle, if ya dare\nAnd hoist that bucket, hither\nCrank n hoist n hoist n crank\nTill ya muscles waste n wither\n\nO the same God that abandoned her\nHas, in turn abandoned me\nDeep in the Desert of Despair\nI wait at the Well Of Misery",
    "From Her To Eternity": "Ah wanna tell ya ’bout a girl\nYou know, she lives in apt. 29\nWhy? That’s the one right up top a mine\nI start to cry, I start to cry\nOh, I hear her walkin’\nWalkin’ barefoot cross the floor-boards\nAll through this lonesome night\nAnd I hear her crying too\nHot-tears come splashin’ on down\nLeaking through the cracks\nDown upon my face\nI catch ’em in my mouth!\nWalk and cry, walk and cry\n\nFrom her to eternity!\nFrom her to eternity!\nFrom her to eternity!\n\nI read her diary on her sheets\nScrutinizing every little piece of dirt\nTore out a page and stuffed it inside my shirt\nFled outta the window\nAnd shinning it down the vine\nOutta her nightmare\nAnd back into mine\nMine! O Mine!\n\nFrom her to eternity!\nFrom her to eternity!\nFrom her to eternity!\nCry! Cry! Cry!\n\nShe’s wearing them bloo-stockens, I bet!\nAnd standin’ like this with my ear to the ceiling\nListen I know it must sound absurd\nBut I can hear the most melancholy sound I ever heard!\nWalk and cry, kneel and cry!\n\nFrom her to eternity!\nFrom her to eternity!\n\nOh tell me why? Why? Why?\nWhy the ceiling still shakes?\nWhy the fixtures turn to serpents snakes?\nThis desire to possess her is a wound\nAnd it’s naggin’ at me like a shrew\nBut I know, that to possess her\nIs, therefore, not to desire her\n\nO o o then ya know\nThat lil girl would just have to go!\nGo! Go!\nFrom her to eternity!",
